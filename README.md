Custom editing tool for RoboFont editor

Scaling Edit Tool for RoboFont is a mouse and keyboard controlled version of what are better known
as Interpolated Nudge tools, made famous by Christian Robertson http://betatype.com/node/18
When moving oncurve points, offcurve points are scaled in relation to neighboring oncurve points.
Angles of offcurve points are retained. Command-key and mouse down overrides the angle keeping.
Setup function has some user settings for the angle keeping and command-key behavior.
The tool works on both bicubic and quadratic bezier curves, and open and closed contours.
All the built-in Edit Tool functionality should work as expected.
