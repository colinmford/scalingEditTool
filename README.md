Scaling Edit Tool
=================
Custom editing tool extension for RoboFont editor - version 1.0

Scaling Edit Tool for RoboFont is a mouse and keyboard controlled version of what are better known
as Interpolated Nudge tools, made famous by Christian Robertson http://betatype.com/node/18
When moving oncurve points, offcurve points are scaled in relation to neighboring oncurve points.
The tool works on both bicubic and quadratic bezier curves, and open and closed contours.
All the built-in Edit Tool functionality should work as expected.
Angles of offcurve points are retained by default. Command-key overrides the angle keeping when
mouse is down. In contextual menu (right mouse click) you can choose whether or not smooth and
non-selected points are affected by the override. Simplified mode offers a more traditional
operation without angle keeping. http://timoklaavo.com/scaling-edit-tool-for-robofont/
